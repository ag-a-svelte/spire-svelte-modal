## Get started

Install the dependencies...

``` bash
cd svelte-modal
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

``` bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src` , save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0` .
